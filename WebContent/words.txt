As the clocks strike midnight on New Years Eve, I will finish a twelve month stretch of self imposed sobriety. A year ago I had got to a 
point where I was drinking and smoking too much and until the moment when I decided to quit I was largely in denial about the impact 
it was having on my health. The scale of my drinking was normal for the social circles I was in Whether the people I was with came 
together through work, football or friendship, drinking was commonplace.

But by the end of, I felt uncomfortably overweight and my mental health was getting worse. I regularly experienced what I would 
describe as depression and felt weighed down with angst. On hindsight, these feelings were particularly pronounced after drinking, but 
they were becoming routine.

I was often telling myself I good enough or that I was failing in my professional life. These thoughts were irrational, but 
as a driven person, keen to push on in my career in public relations, they were all the more intense.

A couple of incidents over the Christmas holidays helped make up my mind. My dad made a comment I found irritating at the time
that I looked a little overweight and that alcohol might be the reason. Then my brother, having been booze free for two months for 
his own reasons, tried to recruit me to teetotalism. He said quitting alcohol would make me perform better at work. Although this
appealed, I convinced I wanted to be a guinea pig for his experiment.

After a late breakfast on New Years Day, I announced to my girlfriend and housemates that I was quitting alcohol and cigarettes 
for a year. Understandably, their first reaction was to laugh.  To begin with, my method of dealing with the social awkwardness 
of not drinking was to self-advertise – I told anyone who would listen that I was going booze-free. Like any good boxing promoter 
I talked up the challenge, creating the pressure I hoped would keep me motivated.

The first six months were challenging. I was lonely at times. I felt annoyed when I invited out, and extremely frustrated by 
how much people lives seemed to revolve around drink.

But I soon began to notice the benefits. I had more money, which meant I was less stressed. I slept better, which meant I was 
sharper at work. I spent time with my girlfriend and visited galleries and restaurants.

 Around this time I spoke to a GP, telling him with pride about the impact sobriety was having on my mental health. Two things he said
  made perfect sense. First, that the impact of alcohol and cigarettes on our health is broadly linear – the more we consume, the more our 
  health worsens. Second, the most likely reason for the improvement in my mental health was that I had made a conscious decision about 
  how to live my life.

So many people my age – often in busy, stress-inducing jobs – gather over drinks to give them a release, and I was no different. 
But that became a banal existence – every social occasion morphed into one because each was defined by alcohol. For me, going without 
alcohol represented an exciting opportunity to live differently – to assert my independence. By actively taking a different path, I began 
thinking creatively about how to spend my time, and this meant life became more interesting. And because I was making positive decisions 
about how I wanted to live, my sense of self-worth and wellbeing improved.

Twelve months on, I feel better than I ever have done. I wake up gripped with anxiety or suffer regular crises in confidence. 
While I smoke again, I will drink, but only occasionally and for fundamentally different reasons from before. I feel apprehensive 
about my first drink, but that a good sign I think.
